# About this project
This is an implementation of the Software Engineering 1 course from the University of Vienna. It was implemented in the Summer Semester 2020.

# Goals of the project
The focus of this assignment is on the architecture of the app.

The theme was to create a client and a server of a simple game. The game to be implemented is a multiplayer game, where the client needs generate a playing map, find the treassure hidden on this map by the server and bring this treassure to the castle on the map of the oponnent and the server. The server needs to manage the games of different clients, validate inputs and perform simmilar administrative tasks.

# Results of the project

The client was awarded 24,58/25 points and 1 bonus point. The implementation can be found [here](./Source/Teilaufgabe%202%20-%20Client).

The server was awarded 19/19 points and 2.4 bonus points (for implementing more functionality than was necessery). The implementation can be found [here](./Source/Teilaufgabe%203%20-%20Client).
